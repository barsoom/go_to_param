# GoToParam

Small set of Rails "go_to" redirection parameter utilities.

E.g. to catch a requested path and redirect to it after logging in or signing up.

## Usage

Include in some suitable base controller:

``` ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include GoToParam
end
```

Now your controllers and views get some methods.

### build_go_to_hash

Put the current/requested path in a `{ go_to: "/the_path" }` parameter hash.

Perhaps from a controller:

``` ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include GoToParam

  before_filter :ensure_authenticated

  private

  def ensure_authenticated
    unless authenticated?
      redirect_to login_path(build_go_to_hash)
    end
  end
end
```

Or a view:

``` erb
<h1>Show item</h1>
<%= link_to("Edit item", edit_item_path(@item, build_go_to_hash))
```

This only picks up the requested path if it's a GET, since we can't redirect back to a non-GET later. Otherwise an empty hash is returned.

### hidden_go_to_tag

Pass the `go_to` parameter along with a form.

``` erb
<h1>Log in</h1>

<form>
  <%= hidden_go_to_tag %>
  â€¦
</form>
```

### go_to_hash

Pass the `go_to` parameter along with a link.

``` erb
<%= link_to("Reset password", password_reset_path(go_to_hash)) %>
```

You can pass in additional parameters for the given path:

``` erb
<%= link_to("Reset password", password_reset_path(go_to_hash(email: @email))) %>
```

### go_to_path

Finally use the `go_to` parameter.

You probably want to provide a fallback path:

``` ruby
class SessionsController < ActionController::Base
  def create
    if logged_in?
      redirect_to(go_to_path || root_path)
    end
  end
end
```

### go_to_path_or

Syntactic sugar. These are equivalent:

``` ruby
redirect_to(go_to_path || root_path)
redirect_to go_to_path_or(root_path)
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'go_to_param'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install go_to_param
